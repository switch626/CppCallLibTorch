# CppCallLibTorch
## This project was a tutorial to help people to run his pytorch code using c++ in VS2015.
Its only a example to show how to call model in the cpp file.

Here lists the environment I use.

VS2015 En_ & LibTorch1.3.1 & OpenCV2.4.13 & Qt4.8.7

**OpenCV2413 and Qt487 was recomplied by VS2015**, in fact, it took me a lot time to do that. But it work through some error appears.

Its easy for you to use its projcet. Good luck!
